# Classification-of-signal-segments-into-voiced-unvoiced-speech-and-silence

The task of the project is based on two parameters of the short-term segment of the speech signal:
➢ short-term signal energies i
➢ coefficient of linear prediction,
implement the procedure of classification of individual signal segments into sound / voiceless categories. When executing the project, the Python programming language will be used in addition to the functions from the Libsndfile libraries and the C-functions of the SPTK package.
The project is divided into segments that focus on determining the short-term signal energy, linear prediction coefficient (LPC) and with regard to these parameters classify signals into categories of sound or sound. The following neural network classifiers will be used in the classification: MLP (Multi Layer Perceptron), SVM and KNN.
The goal of the project is to classify voices into sound or soundless ones with the greatest possible precision and accuracy.
